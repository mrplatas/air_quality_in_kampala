# air_quality_in_kampala
This site serves to share the results of academic research about air quality in Uganda. Between November 2024 and May 2025 our research team conducted a representative survey of Kampala residents about air quality awareness and knowledge. In the survey we examine levels of awareness, knowledge, concern, and policy preferences about air pollution, as well as the effect of two common strategies to raise awareness: an informational video and SMS messages about local air pollution exposure. This site serves to share the results of the study with the public. Overall, we document that Kampala residents exhibit low levels of awareness and knowledge about the causes and consequences of air pollution, and underestimate their exposure and its impact on their lives.
